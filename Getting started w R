1) Use R to figure out how many elements in the vector below are greater than 2.
rooms <- c(1, 5, 2, 3, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, NA, 1, 8, 3, 1, 4, NA, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, NA, 4, 3 ,1 ,7 ,2 ,1 ,NA ,1, 1, 3)
By using the function __ we found out that sum((na.omit(rooms<2)))13 elements in the vector are greater than 2. Answer found 

2) Which function tells you the type of data the 'rooms' vector above contains?
“rooms” contains the type of data, which is called double. This happens when you use the function “typeof()”. But if you use the function “Class()”, we find out that the data is numeric. 

3) What is the result of running the median() function on the above 'rooms' vector?
The median is “N/A” if we use the function “median()”. But if we use the function “median(rooms, na.rm = TRUE)” to remove the N/A, we find out that the median is 2.
